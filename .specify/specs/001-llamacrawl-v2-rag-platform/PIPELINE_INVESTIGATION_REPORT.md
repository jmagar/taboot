# LlamaCrawl v2 — Data Ingestion & Extraction Planes Investigation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Branch:** 001-llamacrawl-v2-rag-platform  
**Maturity Assessment:** Architecture Complete, Implementation at 5% (Skeleton Phase)

---

## Executive Summary

LlamaCrawl v2 is a **greenfield Doc-to-Graph RAG platform** with complete architectural design and specification but **minimal implementation**. All core business logic packages are **empty placeholders** (`__init__.py` files only). The project has:

- **Fully designed three-tier extraction pipeline** (Tier A/B/C)
- **Comprehensive Neo4j graph schema** defined
- **Complete Docker compose infrastructure** with all 11 services configured
- **Strong architectural layering** (apps → adapters → core)
- **Zero production code** in packages/ingest, packages/extraction, and most adapters

**Key Blocker:** No actual implementation in the ingestion or extraction planes. All directories contain only empty `__init__.py` files.

```

### 1.2 Documented Intent (from README & CLAUDE.md)

The ingest package should provide:

- **Source readers**: Firecrawl, GitHub, Reddit, YouTube, Gmail, Elasticsearch, Docker Compose, SWAG, Tailscale, Unifi, AI sessions
- **Normalizer**: HTML/Markdown de-boilerplate, content normalization
- **Chunker**: Semantic token-based chunking (≤512 tokens), markdown-aware, code-aware
- **Services**: Queue management, retry logic, rate limiting, backpressure handling
- **Utils**: Helper functions for provenance metadata, deduplication

### 1.3 Expected Implementation (from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Flow:**
```
Sources (Firecrawl, APIs) → Normalizer (HTML→MD, boilerplate removal)
→ Chunker (semantic, token-based) → TEI embeddings (GPU)
→ Qdrant upserts + Neo4j Doc nodes
```

**Dependencies defined:**
- Firecrawl: `firecrawl-py>=4.4.0` ✓ (declared in pyproject.toml)
- Pydantic: `pydantic>=2.12.0` ✓

**Interfaces to implement (from packages/core/ports):**
- Document ingestion ports
- Normalization ports
- Chunking ports
- Storage write ports

### 1.4 Current Implementation Status

**Status: INCOMPLETE (0% functional code)**

- No source adapters implemented
- No normalizer implementation
- No chunker implementation
- No service orchestration

```

### 2.2 Tier A — Deterministic Extraction (INCOMPLETE)

**Purpose:** Fast, low-cost parsing of structured patterns.

**Planned Techniques:**
- Regex patterns for common config formats
- YAML/JSON parsers
- Aho-Corasick dictionary matching for known services, IPs, hosts, ports
- Link graph and fenced code parsing
- Table extraction from markdown

**Expected Outputs:**
- Direct edges: `(:Service)-[:BINDS]->(:IP)`, `(:Proxy)-[:ROUTES_TO]->(:Service)`
- Placeholder edges for later resolution

**Performance Target:** ≥50 pages/sec (CPU)

**Status:** 
- Specification complete ✓
- Code: EMPTY (0% implementation)
- Dependencies available ✓
  - `pyahocorasick>=2.0.0` (declared)

- No table parser implemented
- No Aho-Corasick dictionary loaded
- No Neo4j writer integration

---

### 2.3 Tier B — NLP Extraction with spaCy (INCOMPLETE)

**Purpose:** Capture grammatical relations and entity co-occurrences.

**Planned Pipeline:**
- Base model: `en_core_web_md` (or `en_core_web_trf` for complex docs)
- Custom components:
  - `entity_ruler` with domain-specific patterns (services, proxies, IPs)
  - `DependencyMatcher` for verbs/relations ("depends on", "connects to", "routes to", "binds port")
  - `SentClassifier`: binary flag to filter technical vs. non-graph sentences

**Expected Outputs:**
- Entities: spaCy spans with canonical graph types
- Relations: dependency pairs → candidate edges
- Annotated JSON for downstream LLM validation

**Performance Target:** 
- ≥200 sentences/sec (md model)
- ≥40 sentences/sec (transformer model)

**Status:**
- Specification complete ✓
- Code: EMPTY (0% implementation)

---

### 2.4 Tier C — LLM Window Extraction (INCOMPLETE)

**Purpose:** Resolve ambiguous spans and extract nuanced relationships.

**Planned Runtime:** Qwen3-4B-Instruct via **Ollama** (GPU-quantized)

**Window Policy:**
- Input: ≤512 tokens (2–4 sentences)
- Batching: 8–16 windows per request
- Caching: SHA-256(window + extractor_version) in Redis

**Expected Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {"type": "Service|Host|IP|Proxy|Endpoint", "name": "...", "props": {...}}
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "type": "DEPENDS_ON|ROUTES_TO|BINDS|RUNS|EXPOSES_ENDPOINT",
      "src": "...",
      "dst": "...",
      "props": {...}
    }
  ],
  "provenance": {"doc_id": "...", "section": "...", "span": [start, end]}
}
```

**Decoding:**
- Temperature 0.0, top_p 0.0, stop on `\n\n`
- Post-validate with Pydantic schema
- Reject and requeue malformed JSON

**Performance Target:** Median 250ms/window, P95 ≤750ms

**Status:**
- Specification complete ✓
- Code: EMPTY (0% implementation)
- Ollama service configured ✓ (docker-compose: taboot-ollama)
- Dependencies available ✓
  - `llama-index-llms-ollama>=0.3.0` (declared)

### 2.6 Extraction Specification Document

**Location:** `packages/extraction/docs/EXTRACTION_SPEC.md` (188 lines)

**Contents:** Complete design including:
- Purpose statement
- Detailed tier descriptions with techniques
- Entity/relationship schema
- Constraints and indexes
- Versioning strategy
- Performance targets and metrics
- Roadmap (7-step implementation plan)

**Key Quote from Roadmap:**
> 1. Implement deterministic extractors (Tier A).
> 2. Integrate spaCy with entity_ruler patterns (Tier B).
> 3. Connect Ollama Qwen3-4B for Tier C micro-windows.
> 4. Build entity resolution layer with Docker/Unifi/Tailscale APIs.
> 5. Add batch write queue to Neo4j.
> 6. Set up Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.
> 7. Train lightweight relation classifier to skip unneeded LLM calls.

This is a **prescriptive roadmap**, not a reflection of current progress (all 7 steps are incomplete).

---

## 3. Neo4j Graph Schema (Well Documented)

### 3.1 Node Labels

```
Service(name, image?, version?)
Host(hostname, ip?)
IP(addr)
Proxy(name)
Endpoint(service, method, path, auth?)
Doc(doc_id, url, source, ts)
```

### 3.2 Relationship Types

```
DEPENDS_ON {reason, source_doc, confidence}
ROUTES_TO {host, path, tls}
BINDS {port, protocol}
RUNS {container_id?, compose_project?}
EXPOSES_ENDPOINT {auth?, rate_limit?}
MENTIONS {span, section, hash}
```

### 3.3 Constraints (Cypher)

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT service_name IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (s:Service) REQUIRE s.name IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT host_hostname IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (h:Host) REQUIRE h.hostname IS UNIQUE;

CREATE INDEX endpoint_key IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (e:Endpoint) ON (e.service, e.method, e.path);
```

**Status:** Defined but not yet applied to running Neo4j instance.

## 15. Conclusion

**LlamaCrawl v2 is a well-designed, well-documented but entirely unimplemented greenfield project.** The architecture is sound, the specifications are complete, and the Docker infrastructure is configured. However, no production code exists for the ingestion or extraction planes—both are at 0% implementation.

### Key Findings

1. **Architecture is strong:** Strict layering (apps → adapters → core) is well-enforced.
2. **Design is comprehensive:** 3-tier extraction, Neo4j schema, Qdrant integration all planned.
3. **Infrastructure is ready:** Docker Compose with 11 services is operational.
4. **Code is missing:** All business logic packages are empty placeholders.
5. **Path forward is clear:** Implementation roadmap is well-defined in spec + plan + EXTRACTION_SPEC.

### Estimated Implementation Effort

- **Core + adapters:** 2–3 weeks (with concurrent work)
- **Tests:** 1–2 weeks
- **Performance tuning:** 2–3 weeks
- **Total:** 5–8 weeks for MVP

### Blockers for Production Readiness

- [ ] Implement all three extraction tiers
- [ ] Implement ingestion pipeline (normalizer → chunker → embedder)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage (≥85%)
- [ ] Validate performance targets under load
- [ ] Set up monitoring & alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)
- [ ] Add rate limiting & backpressure handling
- [ ] Implement entity resolution with external APIs
- [ ] Full end-to-end integration testing
