# Specification Quality Checklist: LlamaCrawl v2 — Doc-to-Graph RAG Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items complete. Specification is ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- 10 prioritized user stories (P1–P3) covering core platform capabilities
- 63 functional requirements organized by subsystem
- 15 measurable success criteria with quantitative targets
- 8 key entities defined without implementation bias
- 8 edge cases identified for robustness
- Clear assumptions and explicit non-goals

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED — Ready for `/speckit.plan`
