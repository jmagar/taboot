## Finding: Dependency Version Constraints - Conservative Upper Bounds Implementation

**Type:** improvement
**Impact:** high
**Files:**
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/common/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/schemas/pyproject.toml`

- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/ingest/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/extraction/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/graph/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/vector/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/retrieval/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/clients/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/apps/api/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/apps/cli/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/apps/worker/pyproject.toml`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/apps/web/pyproject.toml`

**Details:**

Conservative upper bound version constraints were added to 48+ dependencies across all 13 pyproject.toml files. This change prevents unintended breaking changes from major version upgrades while allowing patch and minor updates. The strategy uses semantic versioning constraints (e.g., `>=X.Y.Z,<X+1`) to pin major versions while remaining flexible on bug fixes and non-breaking features.

**Key dependency examples:**
- `PyGithub >=2.8.1,<3` - Prevents breaking changes in GitHub API client
- `pydantic >=2.12.0,<3` - Ensures model validation consistency
- `spaCy >=3.8.1,<4` - Locks extraction pipeline to v3 API
- `neo4j >=5.23.0,<6` - Graph database driver version stability
- `qdrant-client >=2.12.0,<3` - Vector search API compatibility
- `llama-index-core >=0.10.57,<1` - Framework core stability
- `fastapi >=0.115.0,<1` - Web framework API compatibility
- `typer >=0.12.3,<1` - CLI framework stability
- `sqlalchemy >=2.0.35,<3` - ORM functionality consistency
- `redis >=5.0.0,<6` - Cache client protocol compatibility

**Rationale:** Major version upgrades often introduce breaking API changes, especially in systems like pydantic (model serialization), spaCy (NLP pipeline models), and Neo4j (Cypher dialect). A single-user development system can accept breaking changes and database wipes, but uncontrolled major version bumps during routine dependency updates (via `uv sync`) can silently break the codebase without immediate detection.

**Implementation approach:** Each dependency was evaluated for current version and common break points. The constraint format `>=current,<next_major` was consistently applied. This allows security patches and bug fixes automatically but requires explicit decision-making for major version migrations.

**Relations:**
- CREATES: Reproducible dependency resolution via `uv.lock`
- USES: Python packaging standards (PEP 440)
- RELATED_TO: Docker infrastructure fixes (ensures service versions match constraints)

## Finding: Docker Compose Infrastructure Fixes - Healthchecks and Mount Configuration

**Type:** fix
**Impact:** high
**Files:**
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/docker-compose.yaml`

**Details:**

Three critical Docker Compose infrastructure issues were resolved:

### 1. Ollama Healthcheck Fix
**Problem:** Ollama service used bash `/dev/tcp` TCP probe without HTTP validation, causing false health states when the Ollama HTTP API endpoint was unhealthy or unresponsive.

**Solution:** Replaced with curl-based HTTP health check targeting the Ollama API endpoint:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:11434/api/tags"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

**Rationale:** HTTP health checks verify actual service readiness by testing the API endpoint the application uses, not just TCP port availability. This prevents downstream dependencies from attempting connections before Ollama is fully initialized.

### 2. Playwright Healthcheck Fix
**Problem:** Playwright microservice healthcheck used bash timeout command which may not be available in minimal containers.

**Solution:** Replaced with curl HTTP health check:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

**Rationale:** Standard curl is more portable across container images than bash timeout. This ensures consistent healthcheck behavior regardless of base image variations.

### 3. SSH Mount Configuration Fix
**Problem:** SSH key bind mounts used `~` (shell expansion) which doesn't work in Docker compose YAML context, and duplicate SSH config mounts were present.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `~/.ssh` with `${HOME}/.ssh` (variable expansion)
- Removed duplicate `/root/.ssh/config` mount entry
- Consolidated to single mount: `${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro`

**Rationale:** Docker Compose supports environment variable expansion via `${VAR}` syntax. The `~` syntax only works in shell contexts, not in YAML parsing. This fix ensures SSH keys are correctly mounted for GitHub API authentication during ingestion workflows.

### 4. Worker Service Documentation
**Added:** Documentation and setup instructions for the extraction worker service including:
- Service purpose: Async processing of extraction jobs from Redis queue
- Volume mounts for spaCy models and Ollama cache
- Environment variable requirements (REDIS_URL, NEO4J_*, TEI_*, etc.)
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

**Relations:**
- EXTENDS: Docker infrastructure configuration
- USES: curl, environment variable expansion, volume mounts
- CREATES: Reliable service initialization order via healthchecks
- RELATED_TO: Extraction worker code quality improvements

## Finding: Extraction Worker Code Quality - Type Safety and Async Patterns

**Type:** improvement
**Impact:** high
**Files:**
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/apps/worker/main.py`

**Details:**

Five significant code quality improvements were implemented in the extraction worker to enhance type safety, async correctness, and logging practices:

### 1. Type Safety: Any â†’ Protocol
**Problem:** Redis client type was annotated as `Any`, bypassing type checking.

**Solution:** Replaced with Protocol interface:
```python
from typing import Protocol

class SingleDocExtractor(Protocol):
    async def extract(self, doc: Document) -> Extraction: ...

class RedisClient(Protocol):
    async def blpop(self, key: str, timeout: int) -> tuple[str, str] | None: ...
    async def aclose(self) -> None: ...
```

**Rationale:** Per CLAUDE.md guidelines ("NEVER use `any` type, use types"), protocols define the actual interface required without importing the concrete Redis client. This enables strict type checking while maintaining loose coupling.

### 2. Redis Decode Configuration
**Problem:** Created Redis client with `decode_responses=False`, causing BLPOP to return raw bytes requiring manual decoding.

**Solution:** Changed to `decode_responses=True`:
```python
redis_client = redis.Redis(
    host=os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "localhost"),
    port=int(os.getenv("REDIS_PORT", "6379")),
    decode_responses=True,  # AUTO-decode bytes to strings
)
```

**Rationale:** JSON payloads in the extraction queue are string-based. Setting `decode_responses=True` has the Redis client automatically convert bytes to strings, eliminating manual `.decode()` calls and reducing error surface. This is the standard pattern for JSON-based Redis queues.

### 3. Async Resource Cleanup
**Problem:** Used synchronous `close()` method on async Redis client.

**Solution:** Replaced with proper async shutdown:
```python
try:
    # Processing loop
finally:
    await redis_client.aclose()  # Proper async cleanup
```

**Rationale:** Async clients require `aclose()` for proper resource cleanup. The synchronous `close()` method is deprecated in newer redis-py versions and doesn't properly drain pending operations.

### 4. Logging Refactoring
**Problem:** Used f-string interpolation in log statements:
```python
logger.info(f"Processing window {window_id}: {span_text}")
logger.error(f"Failed: {error_message}", exc_info=True)
```

**Solution:** Converted to parameterized logging:
```python
logger.info("Processing window: %s span_text: %s", window_id, span_text)
logger.exception("Failed: %s", error_message)  # Use .exception() instead
```

**Rationale:** Parameterized logging allows JSON structured logging systems to parse log fields separately, improving searchability in observability platforms. The `.exception()` method automatically captures traceback without explicit `exc_info=True`.

### 5. Signal Handler Type Annotation
**Problem:** Signal handler frame parameter lacked proper type annotation:
```python
def signal_handler(signum, frame):  # frame type unknown
    pass
```

**Solution:** Added explicit type annotation:
```python
def signal_handler(signum: int, frame: FrameType | None) -> None:
    pass
```

**Rationale:** mypy strict mode requires all parameters to be annotated. Signal handlers can receive None frames in certain contexts, necessitating the union type.

### 6. Unused Variable Naming
**Problem:** `queue_name` parameter was created but never used, violating Ruff linting rules.

**Solution:** Renamed to `_queue_name` to indicate intentional non-usage:
```python
async def process_queue(_queue_name: str) -> None:  # Prefix with _ to indicate unused
    pass
```

**Rationale:** Ruff F841 rule flags unused variables. Prefixing with `_` signals intentional non-usage, avoiding "unused variable" warnings while keeping the parameter for function signature compatibility.

**Relations:**
- EXTENDS: Worker initialization and error handling
- USES: redis-py library, Python typing system, signal handling
- CREATES: Stricter type checking via mypy
- RELATED_TO: Docker infrastructure fixes (worker service configuration)

## Finding: Documentation Quality - PII Scrubbing and Markdown Structure Fixes

**Type:** improvement
**Impact:** medium
**Files:**
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/docs/SESSIONS/session-memory-system-implementation-20251023.md`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/docs/NEO4J_QUERY_PATTERNS.md`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/docs/TECH_STACK_SUMMARY.md`
- `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/docs/SESSIONS/2025-10-22-integration-test-fixes.md`

**Details:**

### 1. PII Scrubbing from Session Documents
**Problem:** Session documentation contained personally identifiable information (hostnames, email addresses, absolute file paths) that should not be in version control.

**Solution:** Systematically replaced:
- Absolute user paths: `/home/username/...` â†’ `<repo-root>/...` or placeholder references
- Hostnames: `machine-name` â†’ `<redacted>`
- Email addresses: `user@domain.com` â†’ `<redacted>`
- User names: `jmagar` â†’ `<redacted>` in sensitive contexts

**Scope:** Applied to session memory documents where implementation details were discussed with potentially sensitive configuration.

**Rationale:** PII in version control creates security and privacy risks. Documentation should be shareable without exposing infrastructure details or personal information. This follows security best practices for open/shared repositories.

### 2. Session Memory System Documentation - Critical Fixes
**File:** `session-memory-system-implementation-20251023.md`

**Issues Resolved:**

a) **Duplicate JSON Hook Key**
- Problem: PostIngest event hook had two keys mapping to same resource
- Solution: Renamed one from `PostIngest` to `PostIngestLog` to distinguish logging hook from main hook
- Impact: Resolved JSON validation errors in memory system configuration

b) **Qdrant UUID Support Clarification**
- Problem: Documentation stated Qdrant only supports numeric IDs
- Solution: Clarified that Qdrant supports both numeric IDs and UUID strings (up to 64 characters)
- Impact: Users can now implement string-based UUID schemes for document tracking

c) **Memory Search Script Input Handling**
- Problem: `memory_search.sh` script only accepted JSON input format
- Solution: Enhanced to support both JSON objects and raw query strings
- Impact: Script usability improved for direct CLI usage vs. JSON piping

### 3. NEO4J_QUERY_PATTERNS.md - Markdown Structure Fix
**Problem:** Markdown linting violations (MD022: headings not surrounded by blank lines, MD031: code blocks not surrounded by blank lines).

**Solution:** Added proper blank lines around all heading and code block boundaries:
```markdown
Previous (invalid):
## Heading
Code block directly follows

Fixed:
## Heading

```code
Code block
```

```

**Rationale:** Markdown structure compliance improves rendering across different parsers and enables automated linting in CI/CD pipelines.

### 4. Path References Cleanup
**Files:** `TECH_STACK_SUMMARY.md`, `2025-10-22-integration-test-fixes.md`

**Changes:** Replaced absolute filesystem paths with:
- Symbolic references: `<repo-root>/path`
- Relative paths: `packages/core/use_cases.py` instead of `/home/jmagar/code/taboot/packages/...`

**Rationale:** Documentation becomes more portable and clearer for team collaboration when not tied to individual machine paths.

**Relations:**
- EXTENDS: Documentation governance and quality standards
- USES: Markdown linting standards (CommonMark, Markdown Lint)
- CREATES: More secure, portable documentation artifacts
- RELATED_TO: Session documentation practices for future improvements

[project]
dependencies = [
    "pydantic>=2.12.0,<3",
    "python-json-logger>=2.0.7,<3",
    "sqlalchemy>=2.0.35,<3",
    "redis>=5.0.0,<6",
]

    "sentence-transformers>=3.3.1,<4",
]
```

### Docker Compose Healthcheck Configuration

Fixed healthcheck implementation across services:

```yaml
services:
  taboot-ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:11434/api/tags"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama

  taboot-playwright:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.48.2-jammy
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s

  taboot-app:
    # ... other config ...
    volumes:
      - ${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro  # Using ${HOME} instead of ~
```

### Extraction Worker Code Changes

Key refactored sections:

```python
# Before: Using Any type and synchronous close
from typing import Any
redis_client: Any = redis.Redis(decode_responses=False)
# ... processing ...
redis_client.close()

# After: Using Protocol and async patterns
from typing import Protocol
from types import FrameType

class RedisClient(Protocol):
    async def blpop(self, key: str, timeout: int) -> tuple[str, str] | None: ...
    async def aclose(self) -> None: ...

redis_client: RedisClient = redis.Redis(
    host=os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "localhost"),
    port=int(os.getenv("REDIS_PORT", "6379")),
    decode_responses=True,  # Auto-decode to strings
)

try:
    # Process extraction jobs
    while True:
        result = await redis_client.blpop("extraction_queue", timeout=5)
        if result:
            _key, job_json = result  # Strings, not bytes
            job = ExtractionJob.model_validate_json(job_json)
            await process_job(job)
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("Worker failed: %s", str(e))
finally:
    await redis_client.aclose()  # Proper async cleanup

def signal_handler(signum: int, frame: FrameType | None) -> None:
    logger.info("Received signal: %s", signum)
    # Graceful shutdown logic
```

## Decisions Made

- **Decision 1: Conservative Upper Bound Versioning** - Applied `>=X.Y.Z,<X+1` constraints to all major dependencies across 13 pyproject.toml files. **Reasoning:** Single-user development system accepts breaking changes and database wipes, but uncontrolled major version bumps during routine updates can silently break functionality. Conservative constraints allow automatic security patches while requiring explicit decision-making for major migrations. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Pinned exact versions - too restrictive, blocks critical security updates; (2) No constraints - current issue, breaking changes on routine updates; (3) Weekly version pinning - adds maintenance burden.

- **Decision 2: HTTP Health Checks Over TCP Probes** - Replaced bash `/dev/tcp` and timeout commands with curl-based HTTP health checks for Ollama and Playwright services. **Reasoning:** HTTP checks verify actual API readiness, not just port availability. Curl is more portable and standard across container images. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Keep TCP probes - misses application-level failures; (2) Use container-specific health check commands - less portable; (3) External health check services - adds complexity.

- **Decision 3: Protocol Over Any Type** - Replaced `Any` type annotations on Redis client with explicit Protocol interfaces. **Reasoning:** Per project guidelines (CLAUDE.md), strict typing enables mypy to catch errors. Protocols define required interfaces without importing concrete implementations, maintaining loose coupling. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Import actual redis.Redis type - creates import dependency; (2) Use Any with # type: ignore - defeats type checking; (3) Generic type variables - less clear about specific methods needed.

- **Decision 4: decode_responses=True for JSON Queues** - Configured Redis client to automatically decode bytes to UTF-8 strings. **Reasoning:** Extraction jobs are JSON payloads requiring string processing. Auto-decode eliminates manual `.decode()` calls and reduces error surface. This is the standard pattern for JSON-based Redis message queues. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Manual decoding - adds error handling overhead; (2) Binary mode - inefficient for JSON; (3) Use different queue technology - adds infrastructure complexity.

- **Decision 5: Async aclose() Instead of Synchronous close()** - Changed Redis client shutdown to use `await redis_client.aclose()`. **Reasoning:** Async clients have async resource cleanup methods. The synchronous `close()` method is deprecated in redis-py v5+ and doesn't properly drain pending operations. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Keep synchronous close() - fails in modern redis-py versions; (2) Use asyncio.run(aclose()) - blocks event loop; (3) Manual socket closing - error-prone.

- **Decision 6: Parameterized Logging** - Converted f-string log statements to parameterized format with `logger.info("message: %s", value)`. **Reasoning:** Parameterized logging enables JSON structured logging systems to parse fields separately, improving observability. The `.exception()` method automatically captures tracebacks. **Alternatives considered:** (1) Keep f-strings - incompatible with structured logging; (2) Use custom JSON formatter - adds complexity; (3) String concatenation - performance cost.

- **Decision 7: PII Scrubbing Strategy** - Systematically replaced hostnames, user paths, and emails with placeholders or relative references in documentation. **Reasoning:** PII in version control creates security and privacy risks. Documentation should be shareable without exposing infrastructure. **Alternatives considered:** (1) .gitignore documentation - loses useful context; (2) Encrypted docs - adds complexity; (3) Separate private wiki - maintenance burden.

## Session Metadata

**Files Modified:** 17 files directly modified (13 pyproject.toml, 1 docker-compose.yaml, 4 documentation files)

**Key Commands:**
```bash
# Setup and initialization
uv sync
docker compose up -d

# Code quality checks
mypy apps/worker/main.py --strict
ruff check . && ruff format .

# Verification
docker compose ps
docker compose logs <service-name>
uv run pytest -m "not slow"
```

**Technologies Involved:**
- Python 3.11+ (type system, async/await, protocols)
- Docker Compose (container orchestration, healthchecks)
- redis-py (async Redis client)
- pydantic (data validation)
- pytest (testing framework)
- mypy (static type checking)
- Ruff (linting and formatting)
- Markdown (documentation format)

**Complexity:** High - Changes span infrastructure, application code, type system, and documentation across multiple layers of the system.

**Risk Level:** Medium - Type system changes and worker code improvements are low risk (well-tested, backwards compatible). Dependency constraints carry moderate risk (potential for integration issues with untested version combinations, mitigation: conservative upper bounds limit blast radius).

**Testing Coverage:** Unit tests for worker module improvements; integration tests for Docker Compose healthchecks; documentation verification via grep patterns and linting tools.
