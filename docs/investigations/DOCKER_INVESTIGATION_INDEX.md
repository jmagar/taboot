## Critical Issues Explained

### Issue #1: Broken API Build Context Path

**Location:** docker-compose.yaml line 252
```yaml
# BROKEN (current)
taboot-api:
  build:
    context: apps/api
    dockerfile: ../../docker/api/Dockerfile
    additional_contexts:
      packages: packages  # ← WRONG!

# FIXED
      packages: ../../packages  # ← CORRECT
```

**Why it's broken:**
- Build context is `apps/api/`
- Path `packages` looks for `apps/api/packages/` (doesn't exist)
- Should look for `packages/` from project root

**Impact:** API build fails or copies wrong files

---

### Issue #2: Broken Web Build Context Path

**Location:** docker-compose.yaml line 288
```yaml
# BROKEN (current)
taboot-web:
  build:
    context: apps/web
    dockerfile: ../../docker/web/Dockerfile
    additional_contexts:
      packages-ts: packages-ts  # ← WRONG!

# FIXED
      packages-ts: ../../packages-ts  # ← CORRECT
```

**Why it's broken:**
- Same issue as API but for Web service
- Affects Next.js build dependencies

**Impact:** Web build fails or missing packages

---

### Issue #3: Missing Base ML Service

**Location:** docker-compose.yaml (service doesn't exist)

**Problem:**
- taboot-worker Dockerfile requires: `FROM taboot/python-ml:latest`
- This image is never built by docker-compose
- Users must manually build: `docker build -t taboot/python-ml:latest -f docker/base-ml/Dockerfile .`
- First `docker-compose up` fails on worker service

**Fix:** Add taboot-base-ml service (15 lines) with dependency in taboot-worker

**Impact:** Worker service can't start on first run

---

- Network design: ✓ (bridge network, DNS)

**Areas for improvement (-1 point):**
- 3 critical path issues
- Image versioning (some use :latest)
- Documentation gaps

### Documentation Score: 8/10

**Good:**
- Port assignments clear
- Environment variables organized
- Service names descriptive
- Docker-compose syntax valid
