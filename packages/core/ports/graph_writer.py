"""GraphWriterPort - Port interface for graph database operations.

Defines the contract for writing nodes and relationships to graph databases.
Core layer defines this interface; adapters (packages/graph) implement it.

Per CLAUDE.md: Core depends only on packages/schemas and packages/common.
This port allows core use-cases to orchestrate graph writes without
importing framework-specific adapters directly.
