## Usage Notes

This checklist validates **requirements quality**, not implementation correctness. Each item tests whether the requirements themselves are:
- Complete (all necessary aspects specified)
- Clear (unambiguous, quantified)
- Consistent (aligned across documents)
- Measurable (objectively verifiable)
- Covering scenarios (including edge cases)

**How to use**:
1. Review each item against spec.md, plan.md, and related documents
2. Check the box if the requirement quality passes (requirement is clear, complete, measurable)
3. Flag items that fail for remediation before implementation
4. Focus on items marked [Gap] or [Ambiguity] as blocking issues

**Not a test plan**: This checklist does NOT verify that the system works correctly. It verifies that requirements are written correctly and ready for implementation.
