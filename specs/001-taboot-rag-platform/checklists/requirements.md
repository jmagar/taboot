# Specification Quality Checklist: Taboot Doc-to-Graph RAG Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated Success Criteria to remove technology-specific references (Neo4j, Qdrant, spaCy, Redis) and use technology-agnostic terms (graph database, vector database, NLP-based extraction, prompt caching)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning

## Notes

- Spec references existing architectural decisions from project documentation (Firecrawl, Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.) which are framework-level choices, not implementation details
- All user stories are independently testable with clear MVP value
- Edge cases cover major failure scenarios across the pipeline
- Functional requirements are grouped by subsystem (Ingestion, Extraction, Retrieval, Init, Observability, CLI)
